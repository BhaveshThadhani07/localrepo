<p>This is a new repo.</p>

now since we have done all the work, now we 
have to upload our code on github

Now we 'll create a new repo and push 
this folder to that new repo
we'll not initialize readme.md for now
bcoz then we have to also add it to our
local system

before adding the folders and files to our 
newly created repo we have to run another cmd
which is: git remote add origin --link--
by git remote add we means that we have to add
a new remote, the remotes means our github repo
the repos of our github are remote repos
and we want to name the repo -> origin(by convention)
we have to also add the link of our newly created
repo
after this we have to use cmd:
git remote -v, which means that the remote repo
that we are talking about does actually exist?
this is the git repo: 
BhaveshThadhani07/localrepo.git
on which we 'll perform the operations

to check which branch we are on we can use 
the cmd: git branch,
we are now on master branch 
the master branch is our default branch,
but now its name get changed to main branch

master branch is not main branch, we have to 
create another branch which we 'll name main
or we can also change the name of master branch 
to main branch, 
now we are on our main branch

instead of using cmd: git push origin main,
we can use: git push -u origin main
-u means upstream, means we are going to work
for for long on this branch, so we don't have 
to write git push origin main again and again,
instead we can just write:
git push
