<p>This is a new repo.</p>

now since we have done all the work, now we 
have to upload our code on github

Now we 'll create a new repo and push 
this folder to that new repo
we'll not initialize readme.md for now
bcoz then we have to also add it to our
local system

before adding the folders and files to our 
newly created repo we have to run another cmd
which is: git remote add origin --link--
by git remote add we means that we have to add
a new remote, the remotes means our github repo
the repos of our github are remote repos
and we want to name the repo -> origin(by convention)
we have to also add the link of our newly created
repo
after this we have to use cmd:
git remote -v, which means that the remote repo
that we are talking about does actually exist?
this is the git repo: 
BhaveshThadhani07/localrepo.git
on which we 'll perform the operations

to check which branch we are on we can use 
the cmd: git branch,
we are now on master branch 
the master branch is our default branch,
but now its name get changed to main branch

master branch is not main branch, we have to 
create another branch which we 'll name main
or we can also change the name of master branch 
to main branch, 
now we are on our main branch

instead of using cmd: git push origin main,
we can use: git push -u origin main
-u means upstream, means we are going to work
for for long on this branch, so we don't have 
to write git push origin main again and again,
instead we can just write:
git push 

when starting with a new project, always start
with by creating the project on github instead 
of on our localmachine

GIT BRANCHES
if a lot of people are working on different 
feature on a project,
then for each feature we have different branch

in the yt video the changes in differnet branches
'll be different for each branch, both changes 
are different
after working on different branches,
if we want to merge both the branches 
means we are matching the code of main 
branch and feature branch(entering 
the same code, we then merge to code with the 
main copy(original))
Why we create Branches?
In Git, branches are created to work on different versions of 
code simultaneously, without risking the codebase.

GIT BRANCH COMMANDS:
//to rename the branch
git branch -M newname

//to navigate from one branch to other
git checkout --branch name--
--branch name-- -> branch on which we have to navigate

//to create a new branch
git checkout -b --new branch name--

//to delete a branch
git branch -d --branch name--
-d means delete
if we are on feature2 branch then we can't delete feature2
we have to navigate to any other branch 

Now we 'll make changes to our new branch ie on feature1
